i am so unproductive.


git init - intitalize empty repository

git status - see what is stagging area

files need to be staging area to commit

to enter in to staging area use git add filename (here file name is Chapter1.txt)

git commit -m "your description"

to commit changes

now to see what changes have been commited we use

git log command
