it was so worst today!!!

i am so unproductive.


git init - intitalize empty repository

git status - see what is stagging area

files need to be staging area to commit

to enter in to staging area use git add filename (here file name is Chapter1.txt)

git commit -m "your description"

to commit changes

now to see what changes have been commited we use

git log command

git add .

to add all files at once to staging area

git diff filename(here Chapter3.txt)

to see the differences made

git checkout filename

the changes made can be reverted back

-------------------------------------------

now lets see the remote repository
 
git remote add origin url_of_remote_repository

origin is just name can be any thing preffered to be origin as most 
developers use it

git push -u origin master

origin - name of remote
master - name of branch

-------------------------------------------------
how to hide files when our files on public
useful for confidential files

create a .gitignore file 
and places all file names that you want hide in .gitignorefile

-------------------------------------------------
git add a branch 
----------------------
to create a new branch
git branch branch_name (here alien-plot)

to change to particular branch
git checkout branch_name (here alien_plot)
